#Helicopter Game
A flappy bird kind of game bulit using knowledge of oops,dsa and cpp
Overview
This project is a simple Helicopter game implemented in C++ using the BGI graphics library. The game involves navigating a helicopter through various obstacles while avoiding collisions and achieving high scores.

Features
Game Logic: Implemented game mechanics including movement, collision detection, and scoring.
Graphics: Utilized BGI graphics library to render the helicopter, obstacles, and background animations.
Levels: Included multiple levels with varying obstacles for increased difficulty.
Menu System: Created an interactive menu for starting the game, selecting levels, viewing information, and exiting.
Prerequisites
Turbo C++ compiler or any compatible C++ compiler with BGI support.
BGI graphics library files (typically included with Turbo C++).
How to Use
Compile the Code: Ensure you have all the necessary header files and the BGI graphics library. Compile the code using your C++ compiler.
Run the Executable: Execute the compiled program to start the game.
Main Menu: Use the arrow keys to navigate the main menu and press Enter to select an option.
PLAY: Start the game.
LEVELS: Select different levels with varying obstacles.
ABOUT: View information about the developers.
EXIT: Exit the game.
Gameplay: Use the 'z' key to move the helicopter up and avoid obstacles.
Knowledge and Skills Used
C++ Programming: Structured the game logic, menu system, and user interactions using C++.
Graphics Programming: Implemented animations and rendered game elements using the BGI graphics library.
Algorithm Design: Developed efficient algorithms for collision detection, scoring, and obstacle movement.
Game Design: Created engaging gameplay mechanics with multiple levels and increasing difficulty.
